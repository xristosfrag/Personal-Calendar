# Personal Calendar

The goal of this personal calendar library is to help users improve their communication skills by summarizing key events from their day. By focusing on recording only the most important information, users can learn to be concise and to-the-point in their communications. 

In addition to its calendar features, this library will also support a milestone progress manager, which can help users track their progress towards personal goals, allowing them to better visualize their progress over time.

Ultimately, the aim of this project is to provide a simple and effective tool that can help users stay organized, focused, and productive in their daily lives. I hope that this library will prove to be a valuable asset for anyone looking to improve their time management, goal-setting, and communication skills.

In the future, a graphical user interface (GUI) will be added to provide users with a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. <br>
Stay tuned for updates and new features as the project develops!
